**SPOILER WARNING**: This document contains the complete solution to the game. Only read if you're stuck or want to verify your implementation.

## Optimal Path

This walkthrough provides one optimal path through the examination. Other solutions may exist.

### Starting Area

1. Enter your name when prompted
2. You start in the **Entrance Hall**

```
> EAST
```

3. In the **Preparation Room**, pick up healing supplies:

```
> TAKE DITTANY
> WEST
```

### Challenge 1: Dark Corridor (Lumos)

```
> NORTH
```

4. You enter complete darkness. Cast the light spell:

```
> LUMOS
```

5. The corridor is now illuminated. Continue:

```
> NORTH
```

### Optional: Hidden Room

6. For bonus healing items, take the secret path:

```
> EAST
> TAKE HERBS
> WEST
```

### Challenge 2: Levitation Puzzle

```
> NORTH
```

7. You're at a chasm with heavy stone blocks. Use the Levitation Charm:

```
> WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA
> NORTH
```

### Challenge 3: Dementor Encounter

```
> EAST
```

8. You enter the Frost Chamber with a Dementor. Cast the Patronus:

```
> EXPECTO PATRONUM
```

9. The first attempt is weak. Cast again with a happy memory:

```
> EXPECTO PATRONUM
> EAST
```

### Challenge 5: Inferi Chamber

```
> EAST
```

10. Undead creatures rise from the lake. Use fire:

```
> INCENDIO
> EAST
```

11. Pick up the Wiggenweld Potion on the shore:

```
> TAKE POTION
```

### Challenge 6: Hippogriff Encounter

```
> NORTH
```

12. A proud magical creature blocks your path. Show respect:

```
> BOW
```

13. Wait for it to bow back (stay still), then:

```
> BOW
> NORTH
```

14. Optional: Ride the Hippogriff for a shortcut:

```
> RIDE
```

### Challenge 4: Protego Training

15. Go back to complete the training hall challenge. From the creature area:

```
> SOUTH
> WEST
> WEST
> SOUTH
> NORTH
```

Or from the chasm area, go:

```
> NORTH
```

16. In the Training Hall, defend against the combat dummy:

```
> PROTEGO
> PROTEGO
> STUPEFY
```

(Alternative: Use PROTEGO repeatedly or counter-attack with offensive spells)

### Challenge 8: Stealth Section

17. Navigate to the guard corridor:

```
> NORTH
> EAST
```

18. Use the Muffliato charm to pass undetected:

```
> MUFFLIATO
> NORTH
```

(Alternative: Fight the guards with offensive spells, but this costs health and points)

### Challenge 7: Death Eater Duel

```
> EAST
```

19. Engage in magical combat:

```
> STUPEFY
> PROTEGO
> EXPELLIARMUS
```

(Use a combination of offensive and defensive spells. EXPELLIARMUS gives a mercy bonus.)

### Challenge 9: Final Chamber

```
> NORTH
> NORTH
```

20. The final moral choice. To pass with maximum points:

```
> LEAVE
```

(Taking the orb fails the moral test and provides fewer points)

## Common Issues

**"You stumble in the darkness"** - Cast LUMOS first in dark areas

**"The creature blocks your path"** - BOW to the Hippogriff and wait

**Patronus is weak** - Cast EXPECTO PATRONUM twice

**Can't cross the chasm** - Use WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA on the blocks

**Inferi keep rising** - Use fire spells (INCENDIO or CONFRINGO), not STUPEFY

**Guards spot you** - Use MUFFLIATO before moving NORTH
